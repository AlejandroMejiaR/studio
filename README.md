Welcome to my portfolio. More than just a gallery of projects, this site is the result of an experiment: **Is it possible to build a modern and complex web application from scratch by delegating a significant portion of the coding to an AI assistant?**

## The Experiment: Human-AI Collaboration

This project explored a new development workflow, partnering with an AI to accelerate creation. The process was a constant dialogue between my development decisions and the AI's code generation.

*   **IDE:** **[Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio)**
*   **AI Assistant:** **Gemini 2.5**, used as a co-pilot to translate my high-level instructions into code.
*   **Methodology:** **"Vibe Coding"** — A rapid, conversational approach where I described the desired features and then refined the AI's output.

## Key Takeaways

This experiment confirmed AI's power to accelerate development, while highlighting that the developer's expertise is more crucial than ever.

#### The Wins:
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Drastically reduces the time from idea to functional prototype.
*   **Automated Boilerplate:** Eliminates repetitive tasks like component setup and configuration.
*   **Creative Partner:** Suggests novel approaches for UI, animations, and tech stack choices.

#### The Reality Check:
*   **AI is Not Perfect:** The generated code requires rigorous review, as it can be buggy, inefficient, or misinterpret requests.
*   **Expert Oversight is Essential:** The developer's role shifts from coder to architect—guiding, debugging, and refactoring the AI's output.
*   **Clarity is Key:** The quality of the result is directly proportional to the clarity and specificity of the prompts.

## Technology Stack

#### Frontend
*   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: React framework for server-side rendering.
*   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: Core library for building the UI.
*   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: For static typing and code safety.
*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework.
*   **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) & [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)**: For interactive 3D graphics.

#### Backend & Services
